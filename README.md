# Swift Combine stories

Combine is highly inspired by Rx. This repo ideas come from [RxStories](https://github.com/juanmendez/RxStories). 

I learned a lot from this [tutorial](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-combine-with-swift/power-up-your-app-with-combine?u=70935330) on LinkedIn

The biggest challenge for me is getting my head around how generics are structured in Swift.
Other than that this library is very smooth. 

I have never done self made observers in Rx as is the case of custom publishers in Combine which are found in the Chapter4Test.swf
